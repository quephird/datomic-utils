## Description

For the time being, this just has two Windows batch files to allow launching of the Datomic shell,
since the download from the official site does not currently have them.

No rocket science here; it's just nice to not be required to fire up a Linux VM to play with Datomic.

## "Installation"

Just place shell.bat and classpath.bat in the script subdirectory of your Datomic home. 
From the Datomic directory, run .\script\shell.bat.
Tada.
